### Machine Learning
- [Species Detector](https://gitlab.com/smit.kiri/species-detector): Developed a deep learning model using convolutional neural networks that classified animal/bird images to their species. Built a [website](https://species-detector.ue.r.appspot.com/) and deployed it on google cloud that allows a user to upload a single image/folder containing multiple images and get the top-3 species for each image with their probabilities.
- [Stock Trend Prediction](https://github.com/smitkiri/stock-trend-prediction): Developed a time-series model using LSTM that predicts if the stock would go up, down or stay the same next day based on current day news and past 60 days stock data.
- [Fashion Product Recommendation](https://github.com/smitkiri/fashion-product-recommendation): Developed a recommender system that gives similar fashion product images based on user's input image. Used T-Stochiastic Neighbor Embeddings, Principal Component Analysis, K-Means and Gaussian Mixture Models.
- [Dengue Fever Prediction](https://github.com/smitkiri/predicting-dengue-fever): Used techniques like LSTM, ARIMA and Prophet to predict dengue fever outbreaks for two cities: San Juan and Iquitos.
- [ML from scratch](https://github.com/smitkiri/ml-from-scratch): Developed Decision Tree and AdaBoost algorithms from scratch using python numpy.

**Tools**: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, keras, flask, google cloud

### Data Analysis and Vizualization
- [Black Friday Sales](https://github.com/smitkiri/black-friday-sales): Exploratory Data Analysis of black friday sales data (data source: kaggle) and reporting interesting observations and vizualizations using python.
- [PlayStore Apps](https://github.com/smitkiri/playstore-apps): Cleaning and analyzing Google Playstore Apps data (data source: kaggle) and vizualizing interesting observations using python.
- [Student Exam Performance](https://github.com/smitkiri/student-exam-performance): Exploring the exam scores of students in public schools along with other factors that may have impact on them using python.
- [911 Calls](https://github.com/smitkiri/911-calls): Exploratory data analysis of 911 calls dataset (data scource: kaggle). Demonstrates extraction of useful features from different variables using python.
- [Schengen Visa](https://github.com/smitkiri/schengen-visa): Exploring schengen visa statistics and trying to identify factors that may have an impact on visa approval using R.

**Python**: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
**R**: dplyr, ggplot, tidyr, rworldmap

### Micro Projects

- [Twitter Analysis](https://github.com/smitkiri/twitter-analysis): Developed a [website](http://twitter-analysis1.herokuapp.com/) that provides analysis of a given user's tweets by dislaying several plots. Used plotly for vizualizations, flask for web app development and deployed on Heroku.
- [Predicting Graduate Admissions](https://github.com/smitkiri/predicting-graduate-admissions): Performing exploratory data analysis and data cleaning on USC graduate admissions data and applied machine learning models to predict factors most important for a positive admission decision.

**Tools**: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, plotly, matplotlib, seaborn, tweepy, flask, heroku
